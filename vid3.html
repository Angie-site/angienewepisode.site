        <h1 class="mt-5">REACTION: USING AI TO BUILD A BETTER HUMAN</h1>
        <div class="paper-container">
            <p>
                The fascinating accounts presented in "Using AI to Build a Better Human" beautifully illustrate the power of human invention, resilience, and technology. These accounts demonstrate how people have used AI to not only recover from catastrophic events and setbacks but also to emerge from them stronger and more capable than before. The examples of Jim Ewing, Hugh Herr, the NASCAR "Pit Rho" artificial intelligence, and the "C-THRU" technology for firemen all highlight how AI-driven innovations are changing people's lives.

                Jim Ewing's experience exemplifies the incredible potential of artificial intelligence and the power of the human will. Jim's journey to rehabilitation after a terrifying rock climbing accident that left him with life-altering injuries was defined by AI-enabled solutions. He was able to regain his mobility and quality of life thanks in large part to the use of artificial intelligence in the creation of prosthetic limbs and the rehabilitation procedure. Jim's story exemplifies how AI is more than a convenient tool; it can be the impetus for profound change.

                Hugh Herr's narrative eloquently shows how AI can help us break free of our mortal coils. Hugh Herr lost both legs to frostbite in a horrific event and set out to revolutionize the prosthetics industry as a result of his experiences. He was an early adopter of cutting-edge AI technologies that enabled him to create artificial limbs that not only operate like real ones, but are superior in many ways. The story of Herr's journey illustrates how AI might aid in not just rehabilitation but also the enhancement of human abilities.
            <p><br>
                The "Pit Rho" AI interface used in NASCAR is an impressive application of data-driven AI innovation in the motorsports industry. This technique exemplifies how AI can be used to improve humans' abilities in the real world. Pit Rho helps racing teams make better decisions and streamline pit stops by processing vast amounts of data from race cars, such as their speeds, throttle, brakes, and steering inputs, and where they are located on the track. It exemplifies how AI may enhance human capabilities and decision-making to improve performance under duress.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                For firemen, the "C-THRU" technology shown in the final film could be the difference between life and death. C-THRU helps firefighters travel faster and make better judgments by improving their aural and visual perception in high-stress and dangerous firefighting scenarios. This use of AI not only saves lives of firemen, but also shows how AI can be used to enhance human talents in dangerous situations.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                The future envisioned in "Using AI to Build a Better Human" is one in which artificial intelligence is seen as more than a tool, but as a transforming force for the human race. These examples of fortitude and creativity illustrate the ways in which AI is assisting people in overcoming obstacles, overcoming physical constraints, improving performance, and even saving lives. It's proof that AI can be used to improve people's lives in countless ways. These stories motivate us to envision a world where the human spirit and the power of AI work in harmony to unleash humanity's full potential.
